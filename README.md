**Gem5-Mimic Machine Learning Project**
Overview
This GitHub repository contains a project that uses machine learning models to mimic Gem5 simulation results and predict instructions per cycle (IPC).
Gem5 is a popular computer architecture simulator, and this project aims to predict IPC values based on various statistics extracted from Gem5 simulations.

Features
      Utilizes machine learning models, including Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Neural Networks, to predict IPC values.
      Generates a CSV file from Gem5's stats.txt output to use as input data for training and testing the models.
      Collects various statistics from Gem5, including:
                        numLoadInsts
                        numStoreInsts
                        numInsts
                        numBranches
                        intAluAccesses
                        numOps
                        model (other optional statistics can be added)
      
Evaluation:
      Evaluate the model's performance and analyze the predictions.

Model Performance:
      Provide information on the performance of your machine learning models, such as accuracy, mean squared error, or any other relevant metrics.
